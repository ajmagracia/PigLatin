piglatin.js is the version Sarah, Sophia, and I did in class, and remains unchanged in this repository. piglatin2.js is the most current version of the code, and was updated solely by me.

I have opted to change the original .css and .html files as they were hastily put together and changed repeatedly in our plight to get the code running on the page, outputting the result properly, etc.

That said, I tried to keep the page looking relatively the same, and aside from some minor formatting, I only made small changes in the background. As CSS and HTML are currently not a strong point for me, I'll probably come back to this after I've improved.

These are the rules I have applied to the translator:

1. If the word starts with a vowel, add "way" to the end of the word. If the word starts with "y", the following letter must be a consonant for this to apply (e.g. "Yvette").
2. If the word does not start with a vowel, all letters before the first vowel are shifted to the end of the word (in the same order), and "ay" is added to the end of the resulting word. If the word starts with "y", the following letter must be a vowel for this to apply.
3. If the word does not start with a vowel, if the first vowel is part of a "qu" combination, the "u" is included in the shift mentioned in the previous rule.
4. If the word contains no letters, or simply contains a number, nothing happens. This is personal preference because I think applying Pig Latin to something like '11am' or 'C3PO' looks ridiculous.
5.
