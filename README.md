piglatin.js is the version Sarah, Sophia, and I did in class, and remains unchanged in this repository. piglatin2.js is the most current version of the code, and was updated solely by me.

I have opted to change the original .css and .html files as they were hastily put together and changed repeatedly in our plight to get the code running on the page, outputting the result properly, etc.

That said, I tried to keep the page looking relatively the same, and aside from some minor formatting, I only made small changes in the background. As CSS and HTML are currently not a strong point for me, I'll probably come back to this after I've improved.
